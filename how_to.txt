What is "rearrange"
"Rearrange" is a simple shell script that allows you to replace the name of song by its title. At first it was designed for an iPod nano.
Be careful, it will not change the name of the .m4a, because no metadata is exploitable.

How to use rearrange!

In order to us "rearrange", you can isolate the "music" forlder, which should be in "~/iPod_Control/".
When you found it, put this folder in "~/" (at file's root).

Then, you just have to execute the "rearrange.sh" with the "music" folder by doing: "./rearrange.sh ./path_to/music".

If "rearrange" seems not to execute, verify the rights are correctly given to the file (should be "-rwxrwxrwx" when you execute an "ls -la" command).
If not, use "chmod 755 rearrange.sh".

To use "rearrange", you will need to download mp3info (to do so, user the command "sudo apt install mp3info").
